                <p class="overlay">1930. Prohibition. Chicago is under Al Capone's rule. Hidden bars, prohibited
                    alcohol,
                    drugs, gambling and
                    prostitution.
                    The mafia king thrives using violence, strength, fear, but also money. He has to distribute bribes
                    to many
                    personalities, from judges to policemen, to keep his business alive.</p>
                <p class="overlay">You are his "special" accountant. You have to keep track of all the bribes, all the
                    names,
                    all the payments. It is a lot of money, and a big responsibility. You need to be very organized,
                    that's why
                    you keep all the records in your secret book.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Start with some CSS (~ 1 hour)</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>First, please start by cleaning your desk. You can access it by clicking on the "Secret Book"
                        link in
                        the navbar.
                        Carefully follow the instructions below. You can also look at the screenshots folder within the
                        image folder of
                        this project. It contains the desk configurations for all the screen sizes, as described in the
                        following points.
                    </li>
                    <li>At the beginning, only focus on a resolution >1200px.
                        You have to put your whisky glass on the left and your ink pen on the right of your desk, with
                        your
                        secret book in the center.
                        (The whisky and ink pen images are already in the HTML. You have to use flexbox and respect
                        the alignment
                        of each element).<br />
                        Do not hesitate to create html containers and customize the given stylesheet <i>book.css</i>.

                    <li>Here we go! Your desk is now a little smaller. Between 1100px and 1200px, the ink pen should
                        disappear.

                        A little thirst after all this work?
                        Using your DOM manipulation knowledge you will have to display an empty glass when you click
                        on the whisky glass.
                        The image of empty glass is available here: image/empty_whisky.png

                    <li>
                        When your desk is smaller (between 800px and 1000px), the glass will also disappear.
